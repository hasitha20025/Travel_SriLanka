<h1>Best Places to Visit in Matara</h1><br><br>

<p>It’s a sunny, captivating, and busy town in the down south. A commercial city with an admirable natural beauty, creating a modern window to the new world. It’s old. The elaborated coupling of traditional and novel environments collates the city with a perfect for tourism. The main attraction of Matara is its ramparts. Well- preserved Dutch architecture and street life adds a sophisticated well-decorated modern life throughout the wall of traditions for the Matara environment. It’s located 160km south of Colombo city. Nilawala Ganga, an extensive large river flowing into the Indian ocean through Marata beach, dividing the city into two areas. The old town and the new town. The old town is set into the seaside and the new town is connected to the mainland.<br>

  Matara city belonged to the preformation of Ruhunu kingdom built by King Dewanampiyathissa. The blooming days of the kingdom fall down in 1560, due to the invasion of Portuguese seafarers. Portuguese build the well-known Matara fortress, to protect their imperial from local rebels. In 1640, the fort was captured by the Dutch with the help of the locals. Dutch constructed many administrative buildings (VOC) inside the fort and included maximum security. At the time, the town became an important center of cinnamon and elephant trading.<br>
  
  The fort was attacked by the Kandyan kingdom in 1760. Dutch lost their base at Matara and regained control in 1762. Dutch built an additional fort, towards the riverbank of Nilwala as it still can be seen in the fort. Kept working on the trading and grew an extensive market in the city for the world’s best spices and other valuable resources until the British invasion in 1796.</p><br><br>
