<h1>Buddhangala Monastery</h1><br><br>

<p>An ancient monastery stands deep in the jungle, an outcrop of five massive rocks, lost in the chronicles enclosed with a dense wilderness. The jungle around the monastery infested with wild animals let the pleasance remain silent for thousands of years in the rural Digamadulla area. It enlisted in the least-known historic places in Sri Lanka.</p><br>

<p>The name, Buddhangala derived from the shape of the rock formation which looked similar to Lord Buddha lying on a floor. Hence, occupied by the name, Buddhangala. The monastery has been abandoned over centuries due to the transpose of Kingdoms in old Sri Lanka. It wasn’t even documented until if found in 1964 by a young monk who traveled along the dene. After founding the ruins of the monastery, he has cleared the surrounding into a fairer level together with another monk.<br>

    Years later, the monastery became popular as the ancient relics emerged through the excavation. Carefully enshrined golden lotus flowers, a gold casket was found through excavation which are believed to be consecrated by a private donor. The casket is believed to be created in the 5th century according to the characteristics of the outer golden plates.<br>
    
    Years later, in 1974, there had been built a bell-shaped new Sthupa by the former president, William Gopallawa. But, once again it faced a darker period in the civil war of Sri Lanka with terrorism. Until then, it remains quiet and unpopular without the considerable attention of the government up to now.</p><br><br>
