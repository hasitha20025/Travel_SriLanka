    <h1>Sigiriya Rock Fortress</h1><br><br>
    
    <p>Sigiriya is an ancient part of Sri Lanka’s heritage and historic past. Its other name is the Lion Rock and is located in the Northern Matale district in the Central Province of Sri Lanka. According to the Culavamsa, King Kashyapa (477 – 495 CE) selected the site as his new capital. The King built the palace atop the rock and went ahead and decorated its side with beautiful frescoes. An enormous lion was built on a plateau alongside this rock, which depicts a gateway; hence the name Lion Rock. When the King died the capital and this rock was deserted and was used as a Buddhist Monastery until about the 14th century. Today this historical rock Sigiriya has been designated a UNESCO listed World Heritage Site. It has to its credit as being one of the best examples of earliest town planning. A formation from a lava plug of volcano debris, Sigiriya has come to be a respected and much visited place by local and foreign visitors.</p><br><br>
    
    
    <h2>Mythological Past</h2><br><br>
    
    <p>Sigiriya has many stories behind its illustrious beginnings. Archeologists describe as a post-historical archeology turning point of Ravana. They point out that Sigiriya may be called the City of Gods that was constructed about 50 centuries ago by King Kubera who was the step-brother of Ravana. This is described in the Ramayanaya.<br>
    
      Historical archives in the Palm Leaf Book (Puskola Potha) say that Maya Davana was the architect of Sigiriya. Davana built Sigiriya on the instructions of King Visthavasa, who was the father of Ravana. Sigiriya in the past was called Chithranakuta. The Palm Leaf Book also states that King Kashyapa selected this spot for his palace due to the fact that his mother was a staunch follower of the Yakka belief. She was also a descendent from them. The wall paintings that have gained recognition worldwide can be said to display about the Sinhalese land. The Palm Leaf Book goes on to describe the blue coloured lady as the Yakka Tribe and the other damsels represent the tribes of Naga (Serpentine), Deva (Divine), and Gandabhbha (Celestial Musicians) and the flowers depict the unity that prevailed in the country.</p><br><br>
    
    <h2>Historical Past</h2><br><br>
    
    <p>Sigiriya has an illustrious historical past and is one of Sri Lanka’s most preserved historical sites. Sigiriya was used as a Monastery since the 3rd century and after a period of 8 centuries, it was transformed into a royal palace. The Fortress of Sigiriya in early history is connected to several catastrophic events between two royal brothers, namely Kashyapa and Mugalan, where in the ultimatum Kashyapa forcibly took the throne. This prompted Mugalan who was the legal heir to the throne to flee to India as he feared that his brother Kashyapa would attack him. Kashyapa then constructed the royal palace upon a plateau rock in a bid to drive off the right heir of the throne,</p><br><br>
    
    <h2>The Mirror Wall</h2><br><br>
    
    <p>This unique parapet wall was built 1600 years ago. It is a plastered brick parapet wall with an inner passage that counts 2 meters. The Mirror Wall is a stretch of polished marble slabs which adorned the walkway. It is said that the wall was so polished that when King Kashyapa walked passed it, he could have seen his reflection perfectly.</p><br><br>

    <h1>Pidurangala Rock</h1><br><br>
    
    <p>Pidurangala is a huge rock formation that is situated a few miles off Sigiriya in the Matale District, Central Province of Sri Lanka. Similar to the formation of Sigiriya, Pidurangala is also a part of lava plug from a volcano. Although much larger than Sigiriya, Pidurangala its top surface is steeply sloped and is of hard rock, than Sigiriya. Hence, it was not a suitable place for large building activities. Paintings very much likely to the paintings in closer areas of historical interest and statues can be seen at this beautiful place.</p><br><br>
    
    <h2>Pidurangala Rock Temple</h2><br><br>
    
    <p>A few remains show the last survival of the Royal Cave Temple. There is a rock wall foundation which still shows that there once existed the Rock Cave Temple. This ancient temple and forest monastery is said to have been built by King Kashyapa when he commenced building the Rock Fortress of Sigiriya. The Temple consists of a plethora of ruins and the “Image House” which is sheltered within the rock has two chambers. The deeper chamber contains The Inner Chamber contains various Buddha Statues. The journey to the caves is by ascending the summit via an ancient stairway and through a small coppice woodland where a 14.6 metres length statute of a reclining Buddha is located.<br>
    
      It is said that the maiden frescoes illustrated on Sigiriya rock fortress that face Pidurangala and bearing lotus flowers were for worshipping Lord Buddha at the Pidurangala Temple and Monastery.<br>
      
      Apart from the rock being a climbable one, the Pindurangala Rock Temple was a haven for meditation of Buddhist clergy. The hill is inundated with caves and tiny cells, which were supposed to be used by the Buddhist clergy for meditating. Monks even today, meditate in this tiny cells. History says, that King Kashyapa transported the monks to Pidurangala from Sigiriya when he started renovations of the latter’s site.<br>
      
      One could witness a blanket of green which is the forest canopy and vegetation that is spread below, whose view is breath taking no doubt. A long cave to the east of the summit has been divided into three sections by walls. Adjoining this cave is a 7th century rock inscription, which says about donations of gold and fields. It is said that the name Pidurangala in Sinhala means “offered gold.” It is said that King Kashyapa had turned out a golden lotus from all his jewelry and donated it to the monks who lived there at the time. This was before he left to battle his brother Mugalan. It was at this battle that King Kashyapa took his own life.<br>
      
      As the access to this area is easier than Sigiriya, no doubt this is why King Kasayapa did not want his palace built here and chose Sigiriya instead.</p><br><br>
    
      <h2>Wildlife</h2><br><br>
    
      <p>Surprised? Yes, Pidurangala Rock Temple does have its own wildlife around it. The brilliantly colored lizards and water snakes in their camouflage are an attraction at the Rock. The call of the birds from the surrounding forests serenely invades the beautiful stillness of Pidurangala.</p><br><br>

    <h1>Dambulla Cave Temple</h1><br><br>
    
    <p>Dambulla Cave Temple is also known as the Golden Cave of Dambulla, was declared a World Heritage Site in 1991. The Temple Complex goes back to the 1st century BC and boasts of give caves that are embedded under an overhanging rock, which has a drip line to keep the water from seeping through. The Dambulla Cave Temple has images of the Lord Buddha and Bodhisattvas. The Temple is preserved well and is still held in high esteem as the oldest edifice in the history of Sri Lanka. This beautiful icon of historical elegance dates from the second and third centuries BC. Even at that time, it boasted of being the largest and important monasteries in the country.
    </p><br>
    
    <p>King Valagamba of Anuradhapura (Wattagamani Abhaya) is customarily supposed to have transformed the caves into a temple in the first century BC. Banished from Anuradhapura, he pursued refuge here from South Indian usurpers for 15 years. After he reclaimed his capital, the King constructed a temple in thanksgiving. Kings who followed him later added to it and by the 11th century, the caves had become a major religious center and still continue to be. Nissanka Malla of Polonnaruwa gold-plated the caves and included around 70 Buddha statues in 1190. The Kingdom of Kandy restored the caves and had them painted during the 18th century.</p><br><br>
    
    <h2>The 5 Caves</h2><br><br>
    
    <p>The Temple consists of 5 caves of total splendor and beauty. The caves were constructed at the foot of the 150m rock during the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa eras and carry an aura of elegance, in that they are definitely the best from the many caves found in Sri Lanka. These caves can be accessed along the sloping Dambulla Rock which also gives a beautiful view of the surrounding forestry and scenery, where the Sigiriya Rock Fortress is also visible. The largest of these 5 caves measure 52m from the east to the west and 23m from the entrance to the back. This remarkable cave is 7m tall. Statues of Hindu Gods are seen hear and so are Valagamba and Nissankamalla including Ananda, a trusted disciple of Lord Buddha. Out of these 5 caves, the following are the most significant.</p><br><br>
    
    <h2>Cave of the Divine King</h2><br><br>
    
    <p>The Devaraja Lena (the Sinhalese word for cave is “lena”) is the first cave. The entrance of the cave has an account of the founding of the monastery which is depicted in a 1st century Brahmin inscription. This case has a 14 m statue of Lord Buddha which is carved out of a rock and has been painted many times to preserve its beauty and heritage. At the Lord Buddha’s feet is Ananda and at the Head of Lord Buddha is Vishnu who is supposed to have used his divine powers to create the caves.</p><br><br>
    
    
    <h2>Cave of the Great Kings</h2><br><br>
    
    <p>The second biggest cave has 40 seated statues of Lord Buddha along with the 16 standing statues. Accompanying these statues are the Gods Saman and Vishnu, where devotees places garlands of flowers and then the statues of King Vattagamani Abhaya, who reverenced the monastery in the 1st century BC and the King who was responsible for gold plating 50 statues, Nissankamalla, which is indicated in the stone inscription at the entrance to the monastery.<br>
    
      The cave is aptly called Maharaja Lena which is meant “Cave of the Great Kings.” The statue of Lord Buddha which has been carved out of the rock on the left side of the room is accompanied by wood figures of the Bodhisattva Maitreya, Avalokiteshvara and Natha. There is a spring which has a constant drip of water and said to be having healing powers. This drip of water seeps through a crack in the ceiling. The Lord Buddha’s life is depicted in tempera paintings upon the cave ceiling which dates back to the 18th century. This has a direct connection to the dream of Mahamaya to Mara (demon) temptation.</p><br><br>

    <h1>Aluvihare Rock Temple</h1><br><br>
    
    <p>The Aluvihare Rock Temple also known as the Matale Alu Viharaya is a Buddhist temple located in Aluvihare, Matale District, in the Central Province of Sri Lanka. Its vicinity is surrounded by hills and the temple is located 30km north of Kandy. The temple’s history can be traced back to the 3rd century BC up to the reign of King Devanampiya Tissa. It is believed that after the introduction of Buddhism to the country during his tenure as King, he built the dagoba, planted the Bo-sapling and founded the temple.</p><br><br>
    
    <h2>History and Importance</h2><br><br>
    
    <p>It was during the period 100-89 Century BC when King Valagamba reigned, Sri Lanka faced a famine which was named “Baminithiyasaya” for a period of 12 years. To add to this there was a South Indian invasion and the monks of that era realized that there was a danger to the Buddha Sasana in Sri Lanka. The monks went through a hard time during this period and for them it was difficult to memorize the Tripitaka (doctrines of Buddhism) as the conditions were not apt for same. They moved to the hilly areas and lived on the banks of the Mahaweli River under conditions that were deteriorating by the day. After 12 years the famine came to an end and the monks returned to Anuradhapura with the idea of translating the Tripitaka. The monks then decided on carrying out this significant event at the Aluvihare Rock Temple.<br>
    
      It is said that 500 monks gathered at the Aluvihare Rock Temple to carry out this task. The entire transcription was carried out on Ola Leaves (Puskola Poth). However, these well preserved Ola Leaves were totally destroyed in the Matale Rebellion in 1848. Aluvihare Rock Temple is inundated with many caves with earliest writings. The main cave has an impressive statute of the reclining Lord Buddha, accompanied by standing and sitting images.</p><br><br>
    
      <h2>How Aluvihara got its name</h2><br><br>
    
      <p>The name “Aluvihara” has a plethora of meanings and legends tied up to it. The original name was “Alu-Lena” or “Aloka-Lena” which in English is known as “Luminous Cave.” When King Devanampiyatissa reigned, a monk worked on the commentaries. The King of Devas, Sakra having seen that it was difficult for the monk to carry out this task, illuminated the cave so that the monk could carry out his task with ease. The cave temple faced east and because of this each morning the rays of sunlight filtered through the cave. This was one reason that the cave was termed “Aloka-Lena.”<br>
    
        If one looks at the names that were given to this hallowed Temple it all concludes with the belief that the temple has a direct connection to light.</p><br><br>
    
    <h1>Knuckles Mountain Range</h1><br><br>
    
    <p>The Knuckles Mountain Range is situated in the Central Province of Sri Lanka in the Matale District. The name takes after a series of recurrent folds and peaks in the mountain range which depicts a clenched fist with its knuckles protruding. Hence the name Knuckles Mountain Range. The Knuckles Mountain Range got its name from the British, but the Sinhalese people of today call it the Dumbara Kandu Wetiya which means Mist-Laden Mountain Range. The top of the mountain range has a thick layer of clouds that cascades covering the peaks, at times.
    
    </p><br>
    
    <p>It occupies a slot as one of Sri Lanka’s most attractive and eye-catching nature attractions. It’s no doubt a trekker’s dream come true, with ever changing terrain of prairies, rough mountain peaks, intermingled with streams of crystal clear water and waterfalls that cascade down resembling a bride’s train, flowing serenely behind her.

    <h2>Bambarakiri Ella Falls</h2><br><br>
    
    <p>Bambarakiri Ella Falls or Bambarakelle Waterfalls is one of the tallest waterfalls in Sri Lanka. Its sheer drop is breathtaking and today it occupies a slot as the 299th tallest waterfall in the world. Its beauty is breathtaking, but one needs to be mindful of the slippery slopes around and taking precautions by wearing rubber soled footwear is a must. Travelers come face to face with Mother Nature and her beautiful “turnout” of cascading water in a sheet resembling a bridal veil as it roars down at a steady speed, keeping travelers in awe. There is a rock pool at the base of the waterfall, which is safe for a luxurious dip during summer, but definitely not otherwise. If you dare to take a look from the top of the waterfall, travelers will be in awe of the beautiful natural landscapes around, which has been the work of mother-nature.</p><br><br>

    <h1>Sembuwatta Lake</h1><br><br>
    
    <p>Sembuwatta Lake is a man-made lake but still has a hidden beauty as it nestles in the midst of the Elkaduwa Plantation in the Matale District. With its depth of 30-40 meters Sembuwatta Lake is filled with natural spring water. It’s best to take in its beauty and not decide to take a dip in it.

    <h1>Nalanda Gedige</h1><br><br>
    
    <p>Nalanda Gedige is an ancient stone temple in the Matale District, which was built between the 8th and 10th centuries. The architecture is Dravidian and this temple is supposed to have been used by the Buddhists in the area. Nalanda Gedige takes the form of a Hindu temple. The temple is however affiliated to Hinduism.</p><br><br>
    
    <h2>History</h2><br><br>
    
    <p>The temple was built 1000 years ago. The temple has a curious hybrid of Buddhist and Hindu architecture, which no doubt would have been sparked by the total unrest that engulfed the country in the era gone by and the South Indian Kings establishing themselves in the wake of this turmoil. It is a distinct feature that some of the architecture is definitely related to the Hindu religion. However, still, there are no statues of Hindu Gods, which is indeed a curious thing.</p><br><br>
    
    <h2>Architecture</h2><br><br>
    
    <p>Nalanda Gedige was planned in the standard system of a Hindu haven; with a mandapas or lobbies utilized for special events, a passageway section which was initially roofed, a primary focal place of worship, and an ambulatory around this holy center. The picture is very opposing however as there has been no indication of Hindu Gods found inside the temple, and there were uncharacteristic components not found in a standard South Indian style Hindu temple.<br>
    
      For instance, the lavishly adorned exterior segments is accepted to be of South Indian structure from the period of the Cholas and Pandyas; yet the presence of the lord of riches, Kubera, situated on a lotus pedestal in a semi-rounded area on the southern segment, is a component that is found only in Sri Lanka. There are additionally dissolved Tantric Buddhist carvings of a sensual tone, much like the popular ones at Khajuraho in India.<br>
      
      Named after the unsurpassed Buddhist University at Nalanda in India, it has been said that Nalanda Gedige is “one of those blessed spots that have no history.” The astounding absence of learning with respect to this holy place, and why it was situated at Nalanda foils the individuals who wish to dig into its past. Indeed, even gauges of its date of development differ from the seventh to eleventh hundreds of years AD. This was a time of incredible unrest on the island, with South Indian lords setting up themselves in the wake of the decay of the Sinhalese government. It is conceivable that Nalanda Gedige was a strong endeavor at a combination of Tamil and Sinhalese societies.</p><br><br>
    
     <h2>The Edifice Today</h2> <br><br>
    
     <p>The Nalanda Gedige is an archeological site that is synonymous with Sri Lanka’s heritage and is shrouded by a canvas of mystery that surrounds its very existence. The fact that it depicts Hindu architecture, but at the same time does not have any statues of Hindu gods, is something of a mystery.</p><br><br>
