          <h1>Mahiyangana Temple</h1><br><br>

          <p>Mahiyangana Raja Maha Viharaya occupies a significant role in the Buddhist history of Sri Lanka. As history says, the lord Buddha made his first visit to Sri Lanka after 9 months of enlightenment. Lord Buddha had foreseen that Buddhism lasts five thousand years in Sri Lanka. Therefore, he managed the visit for purpose of consecrate Sri Lankan earth from some egregious spirits that caused deadly diseases to innocent people living in Sri Lanka. Among that journey, Mahiyangana stupa was created by Yakkas dedicating to the service he has done.</p><br>

          <p>After the great demise of lord Buddha in India, an arahant thera has recovered the funeral pyre from where the lord Buddha cremated. That ash has also brought to Sri Lanka and again enshrined in the Mahiyangana stupa and aggrandize up to 18 feet. Centuries later, king Dutugamunu again renovated the ruined stupa after the war against Tamil king, Elara which has been situated in the territory of the dead king. After that king, Voharaka Thissa and king Sangabhodhi had taken many protective measures for the Mahiyangana Vihara and so on.<br>

            Recently, former prime minister Hon. D.S. Senanayaka reconstructed the stupa and in 1961, crystal-cut gems were adorned to the dome of the stupa. It was a gift from the Myanmar government which was ceremonially opened amidst hundreds of devotees in witness. If you are travel around Sri Lanka it will be a great experience this religious wonder including in your itinerary.</p><br><br>
