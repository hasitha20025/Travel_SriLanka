Among that journey, Mahiyangana stupa was created by Yakkas dedicating to the service he has done.</p><br>

          <p>After the great demise of lord Buddha in India, an arahant thera has recovered the funeral pyre from where the lord Buddha cremated. That ash has also brought to Sri Lanka and again enshrined in the Mahiyangana stupa and aggrandize up to 18 feet. Centuries later, king Dutugamunu again renovated the ruined stupa after the war against Tamil king, Elara which has been situated in the territory of the dead king. After that king, Voharaka Thissa and king Sangabhodhi had taken many protective measures for the Mahiyangana Vihara and so on.<br>
