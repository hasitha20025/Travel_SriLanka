<h1>Medirigiriya Vatadage</h1><br><br>

<p>Dating back to the 12th century, the revolution in Buddhism started with the concession of the leadership in the country. Colossal constructions with inimitable artistry of Sri Lankan artists, established everywhere in the country. Madirigiriya Watadageya, a monastery built on the golden era of Polonnaruwa, a centerpiece of all monasteries in Sri Lanka. Distinctiveness in this monastery cannot abridge into one. An architectural masterpiece.<br>

  Watadageya’ means a housed pagoda completely within it. ‘Madirigiya Watadageya is a brilliant creation which is one of the stupa houses remaining in Sri Lanka from 7 others. It’s created on three concentric rings of pillars and the stupa housed inside being safe from weather conditions and elapses. Built on a rocky outcrop, has a single entrance facing the north, the door is a huge craved stone frame on the bottom of the staircase.<br>
  
  At the present, the stupa remains in the center. Surrounded by stone pillars 32 in the outer ring, 20 pillars in the middle ring, and 16 in the inner ring. Since the restoration was completed in 1945, it’s open to the public. It’s indeed ruined. But, Madirigiya Watadageya is a prime example to describe the advanced stone crafting practice of ancient Sri Lankan artists without any doubt.</p><br><br>
