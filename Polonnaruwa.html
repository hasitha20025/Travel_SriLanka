All the remains surrounded by woodland are well maintained and with breathtaking beauty.

    If you visit the place, still you can see three levels of bricks that have holes used to insert wooden beams that have gone decayed after thousands of years. That wooden beams have had sustained the wooden floors of the palace. How many storeys do you think this ancient palace had? Its 7 floors along with 1000 chambers in the original palace!

Colossal constructions with inimitable artistry of Sri Lankan artists, established everywhere in the country.

An architectural masterpiece.

  Watadageya’ means a housed pagoda completely within it. ‘Madirigiya Watadageya is a brilliant creation which is one of the stupa houses remaining in Sri Lanka from 7 others. It’s created on three concentric rings of pillars and the stupa housed inside being safe from weather conditions and elapses. Built on a rocky outcrop, has a single entrance facing the north, the door is a huge craved stone frame on the bottom of the staircase.
  
  At the present, the stupa remains in the center. Surrounded by stone pillars 32 in the outer ring, 20 pillars in the middle ring, and 16 in the inner ring. Since the restoration was completed in 1945, it’s open to the public. It’s indeed ruined. But, Madirigiya Watadageya is a prime example to describe the advanced stone crafting practice of ancient Sri Lankan artists without any doubt.</p>
